# Setting Up Local Development Environment

During local development, you can prepare the development environment for the specific module (bkauth) you are working on as needed.

Before starting development, you need to install and initialize `pre-commit` for the entire project:

```bash
# Assuming you are currently in the project's root directory
pre-commit install
```

## bkauth

`bkauth` is an interface service developed based on the Gin framework. Refer to the [Local Development Documentation](../src/bkauth/README.md) for setting up the local development environment.
